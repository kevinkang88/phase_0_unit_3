### Reflection

The concept of database was foreign to me so I went over all the resources before diving into this problem. SQL Zoo website was fun and some were challenging. Having the testing area helped because I would often get the wrong answer and was able to tweak some elements to get the right table. I saw the similarities between Ruby class structures and how tables were set up. When specifying attributes inside FROM..ON statement. dot notations were often used which is same as calling and setting attributes in Ruby. I definitely do not feel 100% comfortable using select so I will need to come back to sql zoo website again after I am finished with this section.
