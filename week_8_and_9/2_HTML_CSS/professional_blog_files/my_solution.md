## Release 2: Get Reviews

After the feedback I am thinking about implementing a div where I can display few previews (fixed # of characters) of my blogs


## Release 3: Integrate the feedback

I have not implemented the blog yet but I implemented my general
wireframe which looks more organized than before 


## Release 4: Deploy to a personal URL
**OPTIONAL:** Look up how to deploy your github.io site to your own personal domain!

## Reflect

This exercise took really long time planning and starting from scratch. I feel like I have a decent understanding of html and css however it doesn't fail to break on me when I am setting up my divs in the beginning. But after everything
is set up including making it responsive, filling out the divs with elements are a breeze especially when I have all 
the planning done. One of the problem that I am still facing is implementing the blog in a beautiful and simple manner. 
The way I want to set it up with previews I had to have some knowledge on RSS FEED and XML. Im going to research on it
and try it asap!
